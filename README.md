![Landing page screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/w1Kk03H.jpg)

A website for the CharIoT project, based on the [Landing Page](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/landing-page/), multipurpose landing page template for [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) created by [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/) and on mock-ups which can be found [here](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AiX-JMkKaAvEjJs3CFJ9S0Sh6-Gmeg) (OneDrive link).

## Setup
- Download the repository (github login required)
```
git clone https://github.com/malikobaid/CharIoT-Website.git  
```
- Place into the root of the web server (in the case of apache2, "/var/www/html")
(please note that this these commands may overwrite files present in the directory)
```
sudo mv CharIoT-Website/* /var/www/html/
```

## Usage
The website loads the required frameworks from knows sources (such as Bootstrap's CDN) and as such are not included in this repository. The main pages of the website are:
- Home
- Publications
- Case Studies
- The Team

Due to their similarity, the 2nd and 3rd pages on the list use the same style file, "publications.css".
